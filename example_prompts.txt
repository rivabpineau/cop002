Claude Code GitHub MCP Example: working with github from the command line.

1. We will be using the GitHub Repo cop002. create a user story in github to create a hello world script in python.

2. update user story. the hello world should display on a web based ui in python.                                                                                                                                                          │
                                                                                                                                                       │
3. update the user story  DOD and AC to include documentation in a README.md.

Claude Code:

Implement user story 1. I would like you to craft an implementation plan which i will review and approve. if i ask for changes, you will update the user story, then recreate a plan for approval. Upon approval, you will implement the user story and ensure you have complied with the AC and DOD. I would also like you to run a complete end to end integration test. Ensure the documetnation includes the steps i need to run the application, as i am a newbie.

ChatGPT Input:
""""
Write a plain text prompt (no formatting) that I can use with Claude Code to create a simple ChatGPT-like application called RIVA ChatGPT. The application should be a minimal demonstration, with only the basic setup: configuration, streaming support, UI, Bedrock integration, and backend. No extra features are needed.

The app will be a refactored version of the “Hello World” web application. It must include:

A web-based UI built with Streamlit

An API backend using FastAPI

Integration with a Bedrock LLM for chat completions

Streaming of LLM responses between UI and backend

Use Python as the stack. The LLM should be anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0 in AWS Bedrock. Bedrock access keys are already set up in my AWS configuration and can be reused for simplicity.

After building the application, generate a file named RIVACGPT.md with detailed run instructions.

You are Claude Code. Create a minimal, working “RIVA ChatGPT” demo that refactors a basic “Hello World” web app into a chat UI backed by an API and AWS Bedrock. Keep it simple—only the essentials: configuration, streaming, UI, Bedrock integration, and backend. No extra features.

Objectives

Web UI with Streamlit that behaves like a basic ChatGPT chat (prompt input, message history, streaming answer display).

API backend using FastAPI that proxies to AWS Bedrock and streams tokens back to the UI.

Integration with AWS Bedrock using model anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0.

True streaming of LLM responses end-to-end (backend streams from Bedrock, UI displays tokens as they arrive).

Python stack only. Reuse existing AWS credentials from my local aws configure.

Project layout

app/

main.py (FastAPI app with /health and /chat endpoints; /chat returns text/event-stream)

bedrock_client.py (thin wrapper around boto3 bedrock-runtime with streaming support)

schemas.py (pydantic request/response models if needed)

ui/

streamlit_app.py (simple chat UI with streaming consumption of backend)

requirements.txt

RIVACGPT.md (detailed run instructions)

.env.example (OPTIONAL placeholders like BEDROCK_REGION; default to us-east-1 if unspecified)

.gitignore

Backend requirements

Use FastAPI + uvicorn, pydantic, boto3.

Enable CORS for http://localhost
:*.

Implement GET /health returning {status: "ok"}.

Implement POST /chat (or GET if easier for text/event-stream) that:

Accepts a JSON body with: messages: [{role: "system" | "user" | "assistant", content: str}], temperature (float, default 0.2), max_tokens (default 500), stream=true.

Calls Bedrock’s InvokeModelWithResponseStream for modelId="anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0".

Uses the Anthropic “messages” API format expected by Bedrock (role/content array) and sets anthropic_version if required by SDK.

Streams tokens back to the client as Server-Sent Events (SSE) where each event data line is a JSON object like {“type”: “token”, “text”: “...”}, and a final {“type”: “done”}.

Handle errors robustly: if Bedrock returns an error or the stream breaks, send a final SSE event {“type”: “error”, “message”: “...”} and set an appropriate HTTP status.

Use boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name=env or default “us-east-1”). Do not require explicit credential wiring; rely on aws configure/default provider chain. Allow optional AWS_PROFILE and AWS_REGION via env.

UI requirements (Streamlit)

A minimal single-page app:

Title “RIVA ChatGPT”.

Sidebar for model (fixed to anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0), temperature slider, max tokens.

Message history stateful list with roles and content.

Text input box and “Send” button.

On send: add user message to history and call the backend /chat with the full history.

Consume SSE stream from the backend and incrementally render the assistant reply as tokens arrive (no flicker). Append assistant message to history when done.

Use httpx or requests + sseclient-py (or an SSE iterator) to read the stream incrementally. Avoid WebSockets; use SSE for simplicity.

Keep UI minimal; no avatars, no file upload, no auth.

Implementation details

In bedrock_client.py implement a generator function stream_chat(messages, temperature, max_tokens) that yields text chunks from the model. Use InvokeModelWithResponseStream to read event chunks (e.g., “contentBlockDelta” or equivalent) and yield only the “delta” text segments.

In app/main.py:

Define /chat to parse the incoming body, call bedrock_client.stream_chat, and return a StreamingResponse with media_type="text/event-stream". For each yielded text chunk, write: “data: {json}\n\n”.

Flush heartbeats occasionally to keep the connection alive.

In ui/streamlit_app.py:

Maintain chat_history in st.session_state.

When user submits, call the backend with SSE and progressively update a placeholder (st.empty()) as tokens arrive.

Provide a “Clear chat” button.

Dependencies (requirements.txt)

fastapi

uvicorn[standard]

boto3

pydantic

streamlit

httpx

sseclient-py (if you choose to use it) OR implement a simple SSE parser

Configuration

Default backend URL: http://localhost:8000

Default region: us-east-1 (override via env BEDROCK_REGION).

Model id fixed to anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0.

RIVACGPT.md (generate this file with detailed run instructions)
Include:

Prereqs

Python 3.10+ installed

AWS credentials configured locally via “aws configure” with access to Bedrock and the target Anthropic model in the chosen region.

Setup

python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) export BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1

Run backend

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

Test health at http://localhost:8000/health

Run UI

streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py

If needed, set BACKEND_URL in streamlit_app.py or via env.

Usage

Open the Streamlit URL (usually http://localhost:8501
), enter a prompt, watch streamed tokens.

Notes

The app streams end-to-end via SSE.

Ensure your AWS account has Bedrock access to “anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0” in your region.

For production: add logging, retry/backoff, rate-limit handling, and secure CORS. This demo intentionally omits non-essential features.

Deliverables

All source files per the structure above.

A working streaming chat with Streamlit UI and FastAPI backend using AWS Bedrock Anthropic model.
